        <div><h3>Edenia</h3><p>In the near and realistic future, Earth is declining due to environmental degradation caused by human activities. In the face of this crisis, humanity is investing heavily in space exploration and is considering turning an exoplanet named Edenia into a new Earth. Several years after the first successful settlement missions on Edenia, communications with the colony were suddenly broken without explanation. </p><p>A fact-finding mission is quickly prepared and sent to Edenia to restore communications with Earth. The protagonist of the game is part of this emergency team. However, when landing on Edenia, the shuttle is faced with adverse weather conditions, causing its crash.</p></div>

          <div><h3>Educational</h3><p>The name ReConnect refers to both the electronics field and the game scenario, where the protagonist must reconnect the colony with Earth. It also carries a broader message, inviting humanity to reconnect with itself and with its planet, questioning the decision to flee to other planets rather than facing the consequences of our actions on Earth.</p></div>
